<h1>Hey. I'm Leon Stoyanopoulos.</h1>
<style type="text/css">body{margin:40px auto;max-width:650px;line-height:1.6;font-size:18px;color:#444;padding:0 10px}h1,h2,h3{line-height:1.2}</style>
<p>I'm a systems engineer. I wrangle networks, lock them down, and build in the cloud. This is my no-nonsense homepage. No bloat. No bs.</p>
<h2>What I Do</h2>
<p>By day, I work in network engineering, security, and cloud infrastructure — the kind of stuff that keeps the internet running and (mostly) not on fire.</p>
<p>By night (and weekends, and too often at 2AM), I'm messing around with homelabs, self-hosted services, and writing code for fun. It's not always pretty, but it works. Usually.</p>
<h2>Find Me Here</h2>
<ul><li>GitHub: (Coming soon)</li><li>LinkedIn: please don't use LinkedIn</li><li>Email: <a href="mailto:leon.stoyanopoulos@mailbox.org">leon.stoyanopoulos@mailbox.org</a></li></ul>
<p>If you want to talk shop about network security, automation, containers, or how to stop breaking your home lab every other week — I'm all ears.</p>
<h2>This Site</h2>
<p>Built with plain HTML and CSS. Loads fast. Uses less bandwidth than your average tweet. No trackers. No analytics. Just the basics.</p>
<p>If it ever looks fancy, I probably screwed something up.</p>
